## ng-transclude

Sometimes instead of replacing a directive completely, you want a small part of the template to behave a certain way. For example, a different disclaimer for the same directive on different pages.

If your setup looks like this:

Template:

{% highlight javascript %}
<custom-directive ng-repeat="ticket in tickets">
  *subject to availability
</custom-directive>
{% endhighlight %}

Controller:

## $location

## $watch

## $filter

## $message

## log

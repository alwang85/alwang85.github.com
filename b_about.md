### I am Alex Wang

I'm an experienced marketing strategist moving into the world of software. While innovative digital marketing anything will always excite me, I want to become a builder. I want to work with people who truly believe in the product/service they bring to the market. I want to work with a team that actually enjoys the continuous challenges of rapid development and learning/implementing new technology. I am interested in both front and backend positions. While I would be most comfortable to work at a place which employs the MEAN stack, I pick up languages and frameworks quickly. Most of all, I want to be part of a strong team working towards a clear vision that I can be passionate about.

Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope you enjoyed my articles/portfolio.
